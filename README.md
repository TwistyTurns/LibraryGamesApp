# LibraryGamesApp

--------How to Run--------

After unzipping the file containing the project. 
Ensure that the Tree.txt file exists in the LibraryGamesApp\LibraryGamesApp\bin\Debug.
If it does not exist then copy + paste the Tree.txt file included with the project into the debug folder. 

Open Visual Studio > Build Solution > Start.  
To start playing a game click start and then choose the game you would like to play. 
You can select "How to Play" button for the rules of the game.
The application itself has details on how to play each game, so I will not be including them here. 

--------Updates--------

For part 1, I fixed the comparison logic by saving the generated call numbers to a sorted Dictionary, and then using the dictionary for comparison against my list. 

For part 2, I added sound effects for completing a level.

Added some background images to make the app feel more unique.

In part 3, the gamifiication feature is the added sound effects:

Also there might be slight discrepencies between the word doc and text file containing dewey decimal numbers (to be fair the POE did not say that they had to match). Main reason for this is that i found it quite troublesome to work with the 000 call numbers.
